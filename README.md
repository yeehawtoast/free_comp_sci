# README

There will be all of the resources you could possiblly want to know about how to help with this thing, but for right now, I'm just going to use my README as a planning document while I figure stuff out. You might never see this history, cause I'm going to squash it lol.


## planning
1. Blog
   2. Why blog? because all good developers release blog posts about their updates and coming features.

### Design

Parts of a blog site: 
1. The site itself
2. Index of blogs
3. Blogs are sorted by tags and date
4. there are posts
5. posts have headers, an author, a date, and some body

steps to create: 
1. Generate controllers and helpers
2. build views and add to routes
3. build out controller actions and model data
