        <p class="sm:text-lg">Computer Science and software engineering, while deeply interconnected, are actually two separate areas of learning.
        there is a difference between an electrician and an electrical engineer: While both need a proper knowledge of how electricity functions, one knows the the practical, hands-on experience of circut building
        hands-on work and labor involved, the other is high-level, being able to see the theory from the practice and designing the underpinning systems that drive the hands-on work. Both are useful, both are good.</p>

        <p>This site will function similarly <a href="theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, but rather than focusing on software engineering, we'll dive into the theory, math, and concepts that allow us to look deeper under the hood.
        Using blue collar trades again: If a mechanic knows how to build an engine, Computer Scienctists and Engineers know how to design one, and understand the physics of how to make them better. This isn't to say a mechanic can't know,
        it's just that their domains are different!</p>

      <h1 class="text-4xl">How it Works</h1>
      <p>Right now, this site is work in progress, with new features being added all the time. Please check back as we update the site with more content, courses, pathes, and features that can make your learning experience better!</p>
